EVAL-CN0359-EBZ
===============

Fully Automatic High Performance Conductivity Measurement System.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`CN0359` is a complete, highly accurate conductivity measurement
system designed for applications involving ionic content measurement of
liquids, water quality analysis, industrial quality control, and
chemical analysis.

A carefully selected combination of precision signal conditioning
components yields an accuracy of better than 0.3% over a conductivity
range of 0.1 μS to 10 S (10 MΩ to 0.1 Ω) with no calibration
requirements. Automatic detection is provided for either 100 Ω or 1000 Ω
platinum (Pt) resistance temperature devices (RTDs), allowing the
conductivity measurement to be referenced to 25°C.

The system accommodates 2-wire and 4-wire conductivity cells, and
2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire RTDs for improved accuracy and flexibility.

Hardware Connections
--------------------

The following sections will describe the hardware in more detail.

The CN0359 have 5 connectors:

- **J1** for power supply
- **J2** for RS-485 communication (*Rev A*) or UART communication (*Rev B*)
- **J3** for RTD temperature sensor
- **J4** for JTAG/SWD debug
- **J5** for conductivity sensor

--------------

Conductivity Sensor Connections
-------------------------------

The :adi:`CN0359` supports both 2-electrode and 4-electrode types of
conductivity sensors. The conductivity sensor should be connected to
**J5** of the evaluation board.

Refer to the following table for the pin map of J5:

========== =========== =============================================
Pin Number Signal Name Pin Description
========== =========== =============================================
Pin 1      I(+)        (+) Conductivity Probe Excitation Current Pin
Pin 2      V(+)        (+) Conductivity Probe Voltage Sense Pin
Pin 3      V(-)        (-) Conductivity Probe Voltage Sense Pin
Pin 4      I(-)        (-) Conductivity Probe Excitation Current Pin
Pin 5      GND         Ground
========== =========== =============================================

.. important::
  The error specification for the CN0359 is +/- 0.3% within the
  0.1 μS to 10 S (10 MΩ to 0.1 Ω) conductivity range. If the
  conductivity of the solution being measured is outside this range,
  extra error may be introduced.

During conductivity measurement, the excitation current flows into the
sensor through the I pins and then translated into a voltage signal by
an onboard transimpedance amplifier. This signal, plus the voltage
developed across the V pins, are then amplified and then sampled by the
microcontroller ADCs.

Refer to following pictures for the proper conductivity sensor
connections. **Sensor connections are the same for both Rev A and Rev B
evaluation boards.**

2-Electrode Conductivity Sensor Connection

.. caution::

  When using 2-electrode sensors with the CN0359 evaluation board:

  - Pin 1 ⇔ Pin 2 of J5 **MUST** be shorted.
  - Pin 3 ⇔ Pin 4 of J5 **MUST** be shorted.

4-Electrode Conductivity Sensor Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTD Connections
---------------

The :adi:`CN0359` supports PT100 and PT1000 RTD sensors connected in either
2-wire, 3-wire, or 4-wire mode; the RTD type and connection mode will be
automatically detected by the software. The RTD temperature sensor
should be connected to header **J3** on the evaluation board.

The J3 pin map is following:

========== =========== ==============================
Pin Number Signal Name Pin Description
========== =========== ==============================
Pin 1      I(+)        (+) RTD Excitation Current Pin
Pin 2      V(+)        (+) RTD Voltage Sense Pin
Pin 3      V(-)        (-) RTD Voltage Sense Pin
Pin 4      I(-)        (-) RTD Excitation Current Pin
========== =========== ==============================

During RTD measurement, constant excitation current flows into the RTD
through the I pins, and the resulting voltage difference across the V
pins is sampled by the microcontroller ADCs.

Refer to the following pictures for the different RTD wire mode
connections. **RTD connections are the same for both Rev A and Rev B
evaluation boards.**

Data Communications Interface Connections
-----------------------------------------

Connector **J2** allows users to control the CN0359 remotely via a
network. The interface supported by J2 differs based on the evaluation
board revision.

Rev A: RS-485
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Rev A evaluation boards, J2 is a terminal block with the
following pin map:

========== =========== ===============
Pin Number Signal Name Pin Description
========== =========== ===============
Pin 1      B           RS-485 B Signal
Pin 2      GND         Ground
Pin 3      A           RS-485 A Signal
========== =========== ===============

.. important::

  The :adi:`CN0359` software is capable of supporting up to 254 boards
  (with RS-485 addresses from 1 to 254) connected to one RS-485 network.
  To improve noise performance, the RS-485 terminal resistor (R10) on
  the Rev A boards is set to 10 kΩ.


  If multiple devices will be used on the same RS-485 network, R10 may
  need to be changed (or removed completely) to comply with the RS-485
  standard. For more information about RS-485, refer to:
  :adi:`an-960` or ANSI/TIA/EIA-485 standard.

JTAG/SWD Connections
--------------------

Connector **J4** allows users to debug and/or program the
:adi:`CN0359` through a JTAG/SWD debug probe. The physical
form factor of this connector differs based on the
evaluation board revision.

The JTAG/SWD debug interface on the CN0359 only supports SWD mode.

Rev A: Standard ARM JTAG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Rev A boards, J4 is pin compatible with
`SEGGER J-Link <https://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html>`__
debug probes that have the standard 20-pin connector/cable.
The following table shows the pin map of J4 in this case:

Usage Instructions
------------------

The CN0359 is powered from a 6V DC wall connector (EVAL-CFTL-6V-PWRZ)
and will run automatically when the supply is plugged in. The
conductivity and RTD measurements can be displayed using two interfaces:
the onboard LCD screen or the remote network interface (RS-485 for Rev
A; UART for Rev B). Both interfaces can also be used simultaneously if
desired.

The CN0359 has the following settings that can be programmed by the
user:

- Excitation Voltage

- Excitation Frequency

- Track-Hold Setup Time

- Track-Hold Hold Time

- Temperature Coefficient

- Conductivity Cell Constant

- Baud Rate

- RS-485 Address (*Rev A only*)

- LCD Contrast

.. warning::

  Always check the excitation voltage and frequency before connecting the
  conductivity sensor to the CN0359 evaluation board. Using a setting that
  is outside the specifications of the sensor can cause damage.

LCD Screen and Encoder User Interface
-------------------------------------

By default, the LCD screen will display the measurement results of the
CN0359. When used with the encoder **S1** however, it can instead be
used to navigate a menu-based interface to configure the different
CN0359 settings listed above.

General Usage Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The text in the menu interface can have one of the three following
states:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Normal** (dark font with light  | Indicates an available option or  |
| background)                       | value                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Reverse** (light font with dark | Indicates the currently selected  |
| background)                       | option or value                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Blinking** (switches between    | Indicates a value that is         |
| normal and reverse states)        | currently being edited by the     |
|                                   | user                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

To interact with the menu items, the encoder **S1** can be turned
clockwise or counterclockwise. It has no mechanical stop, and can also
be used as a push button. The following details the operation of the
encoder:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Control Menu via S1               | Equivalent Operation              |
+===================================+===================================+
| Turn clockwise when there is no   | Move to the next option or value  |
| blinking text                     |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Turn clockwise while there is     | Increase value                    |
| blinking text                     |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Turn counterclockwise when there  | Go back to previous option or     |
| is no blinking text               | value                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Turn counterclockwise while there | Decrease value                    |
| is blinking text                  |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Push button when there is no      | Use option or start editing value |
| blinking text                     |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Push button while there is        | Stop editing value                |
| blinking text                     |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

There are two **exceptions** to the behavior described above:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Home or Measurement Screen**    | There is no selectable option or  |
|                                   | value in this screen so turning   |
|                                   | the encoder will have no effect.  |
|                                   | Push the button to enter the main |
|                                   | menu interface.                   |

The :adi:`CN0359` also has a buzzer on the evaluation board. When editing a
value, it will provide an audible indication when the maximum or minimum
setting has been reached.

CN0359 Start Up and LCD Contrast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contrast of the LCD screen can be set by the user; however, if the
LCD contrast is set improperly, the text may become difficult to read.
If needed, the following procedure can be used to “blindly” adjust the
LCD contrast:

#. Power up the CN0359 evaluation board. If the onboard buzzer beeps for
   50 ms immediately, the system was able to load the previous settings
   properly.

#. Push the encoder button **S1** within 3 seconds after powering on.

#. The onboard buzzer will beep for 100 ms twice, with an short interval
   of 100 ms in between. This indicates that the interface is now in the
   LCD contrast setting screen.

#. Turn the encoder **S1** clockwise/counterclockwise to
   increase/decrease LCD contrast. Adjust it such that the text will
   appear clearly and sharply.

#. Push the button **S1** to exit the LCD contrast setting screen.

#. Select the “Return to home” option in the main menu and press the
   button. The new LCD contrast setting should now be saved.

Buzzer and Alarm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CN0359 evaluation board has a buzzer **U2** on it that produces
notification sounds during operation. The buzzer is activated in the
following events:

- Beeps once after connecting power to the board, and beeps again after
  the home/measurement screen appears.

- Beeps twice if button is pushed while the splash screen is displayed
  during power-up. If this occurs, the interface will enter the LCD
  contrast setting screen.

- Beeps five times rapidly if an internal error is encountered during
  start up. When this occurs, all settings will be reset to their
  default values.

- Beeps whenever an RTD error is encountered while at the
  home/measurement screen. Check the RTD connection when this occurs.

- Beeps whenever a conductivity sensor error is encountered while at the
  home/measurement screen. Check the sensor connection when this occurs.

- Beeps when user tries to set a programmable value (e.g., EXC voltage,
  EXC freq, etc.) outside the acceptable range.

Data Communications Interface
-----------------------------

.. caution::

  To communicate with the :adi:`CN0359` from a PC, use a RS-485 to
  USB converter (or UART to USB bridge, depending on the version of
  the board) and a terminal emulator such as
  `Putty <http://www.putty.org/>`__ or
  `Tera Term <https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en>`__. Please
  check the settings of your software before connecting to the
  board. The output of the terminal program must match the following
  command formats.

.. important::

  The RS-485 interface for Rev A, and the UART interface for Rev B both
  use char ‘\\n’ LF (Line Feed) as the ending character. This means that
  the CN0359 will respond to a valid command immediately after receiving
  char ‘\\n’. Please make sure that char ‘\\n’ is the last byte that
  will be sent to CN0359 in each command string. Some serial port
  terminal software can automatically add char ‘\\n’ to the output
  stream upon pressing the Return key. For software that cannot append
  char ‘\\n’ automatically, the command string should be sent to the
  CN0359 in hexadecimal format with 0x0a appended.


  The CN0359 software uses char ’ ’ (i.e., the space character) as a
  delimiter in the command string.

Rev A: RS-485 Command Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this user guide, the :adi:`CN0359` is referred to as the client,
and the PC (or any device used to initiate communication) is referred
to as the host.

The half-duplex RS-485 interface used in Rev A boards can connect
multiple (up to 254) clients in the same network. All clients are kept
in receive status while idle, and can only transmit data when given the
appropriate command.

.. warning::

  Only one device can send data at the a given time in this
  configuration; otherwise the RS-485 network will encounter signaling
  conflicts. If multiple hosts exist in your network, please ensure
  that no such conflicts occur.

.. caution::

  The RS-485 address can only be changed through the LCD and encoder
  user interface. Set the desired address first prior to sending
  commands to the board.

The following format is used to explain the different RS-485 commands in
this user guide:

**SYNOPSIS**

*address* **command** *option*

**DESCRIPTION**

.. important::

  The *address* is the integer value of the RS-485 address, ranging
  from 1 to 254. The *address* should always go before the **command**
  and the *option* for proper communication to the corresponding
  :adi:`CN0359`.

--------------

**poll - Query CN0359**

*address* **poll**

The **poll** command is used to query the CN0359 for its programmed
settings and its sensor readings. For example, entering the following
will query the CN0359 at address 100 for its settings and its
measurements:

.. code-block::

  100 poll

--------------

**setvolt - Set Excitation Voltage**

*address* **setvolt** *voltage*

The **setvolt** command is used to set the peak voltage of the cell
excitation signal, ranging from 0.1 V to 10 V. For example, the
following command will set a 2.5 V peak excitation voltage for the
CN0359 at address 100:

.. code-block::

  100 setvolt 2.5

--------------

**setfreq - Set Excitation Frequency**

*address* **setfreq** *frequency*

The **setfreq** command is used to set the frequency of the cell
excitation signal, ranging from 10 Hz to 100000 Hz. For example, the
following command will set an 85.6 Hz excitation frequency for the
CN0359 at address 100:

.. code-block::

  100 setfreq 85.6

--------------

**setk - Set Cell Constant**

*address* **setk** *K*

The **setk** command is used to input the cell constant of the
conductivity sensor used, ranging from 0.01 cm-1 to 100 cm-1. For
example, the following command will input a cell constant of 1.268 cm-1
to the CN0359 at address 100:

.. code-block::

  100 setk 1.268

--------------

**setcof - Set Temperature Coefficient**

*address* **setcof** *coefficient*

The **setcof** command is used to input the temperature coefficient of
the test sample, ranging from -10%/°C to 10%/°C. For example, the
following command will input a -2.58%/°C temperature coefficient to the
CN0359 at address 100:

.. code-block::

  100 setcof -2.58

--------------

**setstm - Set Track-And-Hold Setup Time**

*address* **setstm** *time*

The **setstm** command is used to set the track-and-hold setup time as a
percentage of a half excitation period, ranging from 0% to 80%.

.. note::

  Setup time is measured from the start of a half excitation period to
  the moment the CN0359 begins tracking the measurement voltages.

For example, the following command will set a 5.8% setup time for the
CN0359 at address 100:

.. code-block::

  100 setcof 5.8

If the excitation frequency is 100Hz, then half of the period will be 5
ms. The track-and-hold setup time in this example will therefore be 290
μs.

--------------

**sethtm - Set Track-And-Hold Hold Time**

*address* **sethtm** *time*

The **sethtm** command is used to set the track-and-hold hold time as a
percentage of a half excitation period, ranging from 0% to 10%.

.. note::

  Hold time is measured from the moment the CN0359 stops tracking the
  measurement voltages to the end of a half excitation period.

For example, the following command will set a 1.5% hold time for the
CN0359 at address 100:

.. code-block::

  100 sethtm 1.5

If the excitation frequency is 1 kHz, then half of the period will be
500 μs. The track-and-hold hold time in this example will therefore be
7.5 μs.

Software Programming
--------------------

This section will describe the CN0359 software and the process for
programming the evaluation board.

Hardware Interface
------------------

Connector **J4** allows users to debug and/or program the
:adi:`CN0359` through a JTAG/SWD debug probe. The physical form
factor of this connector differs based on the evaluation board
revision. The JTAG/SWD debug interface on the CN0359 only supports
SWD mode.

.. caution::

  A J-Link debug probe (or equivalent) is needed to download the
  firmware to the onboard :adi:`ADuCM360` of the :adi:`CN0359`.

.. important::

  Details regarding the J-Link debug probe can be found at
  `J-Link Manual <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`__
