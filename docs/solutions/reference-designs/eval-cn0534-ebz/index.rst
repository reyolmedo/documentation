EVAL-CN0534-EBZ
===============

USB Powered 5.8 GHz RF LNA Receiver with Output Power Protection

Overview
--------

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) allocates the
un-licensed 5.8 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio
frequency band for use worldwide. Advancements in wireless technologies
and standards, as well as minimal regulatory compliance requirements,
have made this frequency band popular for short range, wireless
communication systems.

The 5.8 GHz band is preferred for short range digital communication
applications (such as WiFi) because of the number of channels and the
bandwidth available. While the transmission range is shorter than that
of the 2.4 GHz band, its 150 MHz bandwidth accommodates up to 23
non-overlapping WiFi channels. Additional common uses include software
defined radio, wireless access points, public safety radio, wireless
repeaters, femtocells, and Long-Term Evolution (LTE)/Worldwide
Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)/4G, base transceiver
station (BTS) infrastructure.

This design provides high gain, robust overpower monitoring, and
protection all in a small footprint, which is a great addition to any
ISM band application where low signal strength or distance may be a
complication.

The circuit is a high performance RF receiver system with +23 dB of
gain, optimized for operation at a center frequency of 5.8 GHz. The
input is unfiltered, maintaining a noise figure of 2 dB, while a
bandpass filter at the output attenuates out-of-band interferers.

The circuit includes a high speed overpower detector and switch that
protects sensitive downstream equipment connected to the receiver
system. The receiver system also automatically returns to normal
operation when the RF power level drops within the acceptable range. The
RF inputs and outputs are standard SMA connectors, and the entire design
is powered from a single micro USB connector.

General Setup

.. figure:: cn0534_led_power_indicator.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

.. note::

    LED, DS1 from :adi:`CN0534`, will automatically turn on indicating that the
    CN0534 is powered and operational. If the LED is off, the CN0534 could
    still be powered properly, but the RF input power into the amplifier
    might be activating the automatic shutdown, so try to lower the RF input
    signal by 10dB and see if the LED turns on.

Connectors
----------

SMA Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SMA connectors are used for the RF input and output connections.

 - **J1** is the **RF OUTPUT** SMA Female connector that would normally
   be connected to a radio or piece of RF equipment.

 - **J2** is the **RF INPUT** SMA Male connector that would normally be
   connected to an antenna.

Power Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - **P1** is the micro USB port used to provide 5V power to the board

Getting Started
---------------

Required Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - :adi:`EVAL-CN0534-EBZ Board <CN0534>`

 - :adi:`ADALM-Pluto`

 - Two (2) micro-USB power adaptors OR Two (2) micro-USB to USB cables
   for powering up ADALM-Pluto and EVAL- CN0534-EBZ

 - One (1) SMA male to SMA male cable

 - One (1) SMA 10dB RF Attenuator (6610_SMA-50-2/199_NE) OR any
   equivalent RF Attenuator with same attenuation or higher

ADALM-Pluto Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firmware Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Download the :git-plutosdr-fw:`latest Pluto firmware <releases/latest+>`.

#.  Unzip downloaded folder.

#.  Connect Pluto to PC/Laptop using micro USB cable in the terminal
    with USB symbol.

#.  Open the Pluto mass storage device.

#.  Open the downloaded firmware file.

#.  Copy the file, pluto.frm, to the Pluto mass storage device

 .. figure:: pluto_firmware_update.jpg
    :align: center
    :width: 800px

#.  This will cause LED1 to blink rapidly. This means programming is
    taking place. Do not remove power (or USB) while the device is
    blinking rapidly. It does take approximately 4 minutes to properly
    program the device.

#.  Once the device is done programming, it will re-appear as a mass
    storage device.

#.  Eject (don’t unplug) the Pluto mass storage device.

 .. figure:: eject_pluto.jpg
    :align: center

#. Now the USB cable can now be safely disconnected in the PC.

Updating to the AD9364
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Connect again the Pluto to PC/Laptop using micro USB cable.

#. Open any serial application (ex. TeraTerm, Putty) and ssh to
   192.168.2.1, username is root and the password is analog.

 .. figure:: tera_term_connection.jpg

 .. figure:: username_and_password.jpg
    :align: center

#. To change things to the AD9364 configuration, type in the following
   commands, line by line:

   .. code-block::

      # fw_setenv attr_name compatible
      # fw_setenv attr_val ad9364
      # reboot

 .. figure:: command_line_to_update_ad9364.jpg
    :align: center

#. Eject (don’t unplug) the Pluto mass storage device.

#. Now the USB cable can now be safely disconnected in the PC.

#. Connect again Pluto to PC/Laptop using micro USB cable and proceed
   setting up the hardware test setup following the instruction in the
   next section.

Test Setup
~~~~~~~~~~

Normal Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 .. figure:: cn0534_and_adalm_pluto_test_setup.png
    :align: center
    :width: 800px

#. Connect the RF Tx of Pluto SDR to J2 of the
   :adi:`EVAL-CN0534-EBZ Board <CN0534>`.

#. Connect J1 of the :adi:`EVAL-CN0534-EBZ Board <CN0534>`
   to the RF Rx of Pluto SDR

#. Connect P1 (micro USB) connector of the
   :adi:`EVAL-CN0534-EBZ Board <CN0534>` into a PC USB port
   or 5 V USB charger.

#. The DS1 LED of CN0534 will automatically turn on indicating the board
   is powered on and is in operation.

.. important::

    The ADALM-Pluto can be configured using an IIO Oscilloscope,
    visit the website on

     - :ref:`iio-oscilloscope` to know more about the tool.

     - Optional: an RF attenuator can be connected in between the
       :adi:`EVAL-CN0534-EBZ Board <CN0534>` RF Output and the RF
       Rx of Pluto SDR to protect the Rx of Pluto from exceeding
       its limits.

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

    Make sure to download/update to the latest version of
    IIO-Oscilloscope found on this
    :git-iio-oscilloscope:`link <releases+>`.

#. Once done with the installation or an update of the latest
   IIO-Oscilloscope, open the application. The user needs to supply a
   URI which will be used in the context creation of the IIO
   Oscilloscope and the instructions can be seen from the previous
   section.

#. Press refresh to display available IIO Devices, once ADALM-Pluto
   appeared, press connect.

WARNING
-------

.. warning::

    Connecting the :adi:`EVAL-CN0534-EBZ Board <CN0534>` directly
    to the input (Rx) of a radio or other piece of RF equipment may
    exceed the absolute maximum ratings for the RF Input. (which is +2.5 dBm
    for the ADALM-PLUTO). Doing this may permanently damage the input.

    .. figure:: cn0534_sample_application.png
       :align: center
       :width: 700px

    Never do this in normal operation.
