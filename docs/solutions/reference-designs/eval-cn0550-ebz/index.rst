EVAL-CN0550-EBZ
===============

Low/Full/High-Speed USB 2.0 Isolator with Isolated Power.

General Description
-------------------

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0550-EBZ <CN0550>` is a 4-layer printed circuit board (PCB)
that allows evaluation of the :adi:`CN0550 <CN0550>` High Speed USB 2.0
Peripheral Isolator circuit. The board is fabricated with a ``0.5oz./1oz.``
copper cladding and IPC-4101 (or IPC-4103) laminates and bonding materials.

Designed to be connected between a host controller and a USB peripheral
device, the :adi:`EVAL-CN0550-EBZ <CN0550>` features a small form-factor
with dimensions of 2.315in ×1.335in x 0.062mm (PCB only).
The evaluation board uses standard Type-A USB connectors for its
signal path — for easy integration with USB systems, a male connector is used
for the host side and a female connector is used for the peripheral side.
Straight headers on each side allow the users to use an external power supply
for high current applications.

USB Host Plug and LED Indicator (P1, BUS1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The USB host controller must be connected to the male USB-A connector (P1).

*The yellow-green LED (BUS1) lights up to indicate the presence of 5V power
from the USB host.*

USB Peripheral Port and LED Indicator (P2, BUS2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The USB peripheral device must be connected to the female USB-A connector
(P2).

*The yellow-green LED (BUS2) lights up to indicate the presence of 5V power
for the USB peripheral device.*

Host Side Power Connector and LED Indicator (P3, EXT1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The onboard regulator circuit of the CN0550 can typically
supply a maximum current of 440mA to the peripheral side when powered from
the VCC pin of the USB host. For applications that require higher current,
the CN0550 output can be increased by moving the J1 solder jumper to the ‘B’
position, and connecting an external >5VDC power supply across the P3
header.

*The red LED (EXT1) lights up to indicate the presence of an external DC power
supply.*

.. tip::

   The maximum voltage that can be safely applied at
   P3 is 32 V. Connect the (+) and (-) pins of the external power supply
   respectively to pins 1 and 2 of P3.

Peripheral Side Power Connector and LED Indicator (P4, EXT2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For applications where 5V power is already available on the peripheral side,
the onboard regulator can be bypassed by moving the J2 solder jumper to the
‘B’ position, and connecting the external 5V peripheral power across the P3
header.

.. tip::

   The voltage applied at P3 should be limited to
   the normal operating VCC range for USB (4.75V to 5.25V). Connect the (+)
   and (-) pins of the external power supply respectively to pins 1 and 2 of P4.
