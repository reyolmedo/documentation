================

USB 3.0 Quad-Channel IEPE Vibration Sensor Measurement System.

General Description
-------------------

:adi:`CN0582` or the USB 3.0 Quad-Channel IEPE Vibration Sensor
Measurement System is a system board capable of reading data
from analog (IEPE) accelerometers. The analog IEPE inputs also
contain current source switches to accommodate sensors that might
need external power and individual channel offset voltage setting.

Aside from IEPE sensor measurements, the board is also an arbitrary
sinewave generator providing stimulus to an external vibration shaker
and a multi-channel data acquisition system.

Requirements
------------

The USB 3.0 Quad-Channel IEPE Vibration Sensor Measurement System is a
complete system from Hardware, Firmware, to Software for performing
basic Data acquisition (DAQ) functions and vibration tests.

The following sections will detail the necessary steps and conditions
needed to fully operate the system.

**Firmware**

Once the USB 3.0 Quad-Channel IEPE Vibration Sensor Measurement System
is installed via the given installer (Refer to the Installation Guide
section), the compatible firmware is located within the same folder as
the GUI executable file.

At startup, the GUI uploads the firmware to the board for easier use.
Do not remove the firmware (.img file) in the folder to avoid errors.

   CN0582 Firmware

Should there be any updates necessary, uninstall the GUI and
corresponding files using the uninstaller (C:\\Analog Devices\\USB3.0
Based Multi-Channel Test Platform for Vibration
Sensor\\Uninstall.exe). An updated installer containing the updated
firmware and other files will be uploaded for download.

**Equipment Needed**

- Computer running Windows 10 OS
- Signal Generator (optional).
- Digital Multimeter (optional).
- Vibration Shaker (i.e., King Design).
- Piezo Reference Sensor (i.e., 352C67 from PCB Piezotronics).
- Test Sensor (i.e., Type 4394 from Brüel and Kjær).

**Accessories Needed**

- BNC-to-SMA cable (x1).
- SMA-to-SMA cable (x4).
- USB Type C cable
- 5V power Supply(optional).

**Power Supply Requirements**

The board can be powered up via USB3.0 or external Power Supply:

   :align: center

   Multi-Channel Vibration Test Power Supply

The Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform can automatically prioritize
the external power supply if detected then switch back to USB port if
unplugged. Since Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform has the
capability to operate as Dual-Role Port (DRP), it can also adjust
power requirements as needed based on the application such as when a
device is connected, it will provide power and will act as HOST.

.. note::

    NOTE: For the External Power Supply, the recommended voltage
    is from 4.5 V to 5.5 V.

Installation Guide
------------------

The CN0582 Evaluation Software.exe is a single file installer that
includes the GUI installer, uninstaller, and driver installer. The
installer will create the files and folders required to operate CN0582
and the corresponding applications.

.. admonition:: Download

   :download:`CN0582 Evaluation Software Installer <http://swdownloads.analog.com/cse/cftl/CN0582/CN0582%20EVALUATION%20SOFTWARE%20INSTALLER.EXE>`

**GUI Installer**

This will setup the dependencies folder which will also contain the
USB 3.0 Quad-Channel IEPE Vibration Sensor Measurement System GUI
executable file.

**Driver Installer**

Running the driver installer is necessary to fully setup the necessary
drivers and make the board recognizable by the software.

**GUI Removal**

To uninstall the GUI, run the file named Uninstall.exe in the same
location as the GUI executable file. Running this will remove the
folder created by the installer and its contents.

.. figure:: uninstall.png
   :align: center

   Uninstall Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform

.. note::

    The folder containing the screenshots from the file export
    functionality (Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform File
    Exports folder) isn’t deleted by this installer so this
    should be deleted manually.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

**Interconnection**

The Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform requires any type C
connector to interface with host and is backward compatible with
USB2.0. For Best performance, it is recommended to connect with USB3.0
ports and corresponding cable.

**Boot options**

The Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform has 2 boot options: SPI and
USB boot. SPI boot loads the firmware stored in the SPI flash memory,
if any. This is useful when a custom firmware already loaded onboard
is needed or for instances where the board would undergo a power
restart and immediate loading, with no software intervention, is
needed.

The other option, USB boot, is the default for all CN-0582 boards.
Restarting the board in this mode registers the board as a bootloader
instead of a valid device. This allows bundling the software with the
hardware since the GUI will be responsible for uploading the firmware
to the board and not having the necessary software renders the
hardware unusable.

**GUI Usage**

The Multi-Channel Vibration Test Platform Board default boot setup is
for USB boot, allowing the firmware to be loaded via software. The
installer, once done running, sets up the dependencies, firmware, and
the executable file to run the GUI itself.

At every startup, the GUI uploads the firmware and proceeds if
successful. Otherwise, the GUI won’t proceed while giving prompts for
next actions.

At exit, the GUI resets the different board settings such as the
signal generator output amplitude and frequency, channel offset, and
current source button status. This is for the board to have a known
state upon exit and ensure safety for connected components.
