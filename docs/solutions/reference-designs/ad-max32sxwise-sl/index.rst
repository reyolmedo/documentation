What is a Base Board?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Base Board contains an RF transceiver chip and a microcontroller, which
combine all the required elements for long range communication. This platform
uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, allowing sensors to connect to a
network and send and receive data in long distances.

MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This development kit comes with the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` as its base board.
This board is consisting of the MAX32670 high-reliability, ultralow power
microcontroller based on Arm Cortex-M4 processor, and the SX1261
long range transceiver module.

.. figure:: max32670-sx-ardz_base_board.png

What are Sensor Nodes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sensor nodes are devices that wirelessly send or receive messages to and back
from the gateways. These devices communicate with nearby gateways connected
through a network server. Depending on the intended applications, sensors can
transmit various type of data such as temperature, flow rate, vibration, etc.

Below are the sensor nodes compatible with the MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board.
All of these 3 sensors are included in the :adi:`AD-MAX32SXWISE-SL` development kit.

EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ Sensor for Structural Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :adi:`EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ` is a vibration sensor that uses the
ADXL343 digital output MEMS accelerometer chip and the
ADIS16203 programmable 360° inclinometer. Aside from providing vibration data,
this end node also features the MAX30210 digital temperature sensor which gives
the option to shut down sensitive machines and equipment for smart motor sensing
applications. This vibration sensor can also detect if the horizontal position
of the sensor changes, which points towards a collapse of the structure where
the sensor was deployed.

EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ Sensor for Flow Rate Metering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :adi:`EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ` is an ultrasonic time-of-flight (ToF) flow meter
that sends and receives ultrasound waves between piezoelectric transducers
in both the upstream and downstream directions in the pipe. By measuring the
TOF difference between the upstream and downstream wave travels,
utilizing sophisticated digital signal processing techniques, a very
accurate flow rate can be calculated.

  :width: 400px

EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ Sensor for Electric Metering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` is an Arduino shield compatible with Arduino Zero.
The shield can be directly interfaced with current transformers and voltage leads.
It enables quick evaluation and prototyping of energy and power quality
measurement systems with the ADE9000. Arduino library and application examples
are provided to simplify implementation of larger systems.

System Setup
------------

PHASE 1: Hardware Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that this setup only applies for MAX32670-SX-ARDZ Base Board. Users may use
a different base board or microcontroller, however the firmware built for this
demo application cannot be used as this is specifically designed for the
MAX32670-SX-ARDZ.

Equipment Needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- One (1) :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board
- One (1) Sensor Node, any of these:
    - :adi:`EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ`, :adi:`EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ`, :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ`
- One (1) MAX32625PICO Rapid Development Platform with 10-pin ribbon cable
  with :git-max32625pico-firmware-images:`firmware image <raw+master:bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`
- One (1) CR123A Battery or any equivalent external DC power supply (+3V to +4.7V).
  **Note that this is not included in the kit**
- One (1) Micro USB to USB cable
- Host PC (Windows 10 or later)

.. figure:: hardware_setup.png

#.  Insert one CR123A battery (3V to 4.7V) into the battery holder
    (BT1 connector) of the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board.

    **Make sure to check for the battery polarity in the BT1 connector,
    refer to the figure below. The DS3 LED will light up indicating
    that you have inserted the battery correctly and that power is
    provided in the base board.**

    .. figure:: base_board_with_battery.png

#.  Connect one **Sensor Node** to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board
    by aligning the corresponding Arduino headers on each board.

    You do not have to set up the three sensor nodes altogether, just choose
    **one** from the available sensors in the kit:

    - :adi:`EV-STRUCTURAL-ARDZ` for Structural Monitoring
    - :adi:`EV-FLOWMETER-ARDZ` for Flow Rate Metering
    - :adi:`EV-ADE9000SHIELDZ` for Electric Metering

    .. tip::

      Make sure that the MAX32625PICO programming adapter has been flashed with
      the correct image before connecting it to the MAX32670-LR-ARDZ Base
      Board.

**How to flash the firmware image in the MAX32625PICO**

#. Download the firmware image:
   :git-max32625pico-firmware-images:`MAX32625PICO Firmware Image for MAX32670 <raw+master:bin/max32625_max32670evkit_if_crc_swd_v1.0.3.bin>`
#. Do not connect the MAX32625PICO to the :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board yet.
#. Connect the MAX32625PICO to the Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.
#. Press the button on the MAX32625PICO. **(Do not release the button until the
   MAINTENANCE drive is mounted)**.
#. Release the button once the MAINTENANCE drive is mounted.
#. Drag and drop (to the MAINTENANCE drive) the firmware image.
#. After a few seconds, the MAINTENANCE drive will disappear and be replaced by
   a drive named DAPLINK. This indicates that the process is complete, and the
   MAX32625PICO can now be used to flash the firmware of the
   :adi:`MAX32670-SX-ARDZ` Base Board.

#. Connect the :adi:`MAX32625PICO` programming adapter to the
   Host PC using the micro USB to USB cable.

FAQs
----

- **Q.** Why is the serial application not responding after opening the port?
- **A.** It usually happens whenever the power of the base board is not enough to operate the board.

- **Q.** Can we use other gateways aside from ChirpStack?
- **A.** Customers are not limited to use ChirpStack gateway, it is possible to use other gateways available in the market.

- **Q.** What maximum number a gateway can handle?
- **A.** It depends on the channels available per assigned region and the time division
  set by the user on sending data from the nodes to gateway.

- **Q.** Is there another way to see the GUI without using the local setup?
- **A.** The GUI can also be accessed through cloud service, but it is not supported by ADI.

- **Q.** What is the maximum distance the gateway and nodes can communicate?
- **A.** The gateway and nodes' maximum and effective range may vary
  depending on the modulation parameters, transmit power, antenna gain,
  environmental conditions, and obstacles present in the communication
  path. In practice, it can reach several kilometers in rural areas with
  a clear line of sight. The effective range may be shorter in urban
  areas where obstacle and interference are present.
