Power Supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This evaluation board is designed to be supplied via the EVAL-SDP-CH1Z.
The EVAL-SDP-CH1Z generates 12 V and 3.3 V supply rails. The 12 V supply
is connected to the on-board 5 V linear regulator that supplies the
ADuM6000 with power. The ADuM6000 then generates an isolated 5 V supply
to power the VDD1 rail of the AD7405. The 3.3 V supply rail from the
EVAL-SDP-CH1Z is used to supply the VDD2 rail of the AD7405.

If the user wishes to supply VDD1 externally, an external power supply in
the range of 24 V ± 5% may be connected to the HIGH_V connector, J4.
Alternatively an external supply in the range of 5 V ± 10% may be
connected to the J3 connector.

The VDD2 supply may also be supplied via an external power supply in the
range of 3 V to 5.5 V via the J5 connector.

There are two main ground planes, GND1 and GND2. These are isolated
planes with a creepage and clearance of 8 mm.

.. caution::
   When the EVAL-AD7405FMCZ is connected to the EVAL-SDP-CH1Z,
   take care to ensure that if an external voltage is supplied to the J5
   input connector, the voltage does not exceed 3.3 V. Exceeding this
   voltage may cause permanent damage to the EVAL-SDP-CH1Z board.

   Waveform Analysis Tab

Generating a Historam of the ADC Code Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Histogram** tab (see Figure 17) can be used to perform ac testing or,
more commonly, dc testing. This tab shows the ADC code distribution of
the input and computes the mean and standard deviation, which are
displayed as **DC Offset/Mean** and **Transition Noise**, respectively, in the
**Histogram Analysis** area (labeled 2 in Figure 17).

   :align: center
   :width: 800

   Histogram Capture Tab

Generating a Fast Fourier Transform of AC Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Figure 18 shows the **FFT** tab. This feature tests the traditional ac
characteristics of the converter and displays a fast Fourier transform
(FFT) of the results.

To perform an ac test,

1. Apply a bipolar sinusoidal signal with low distortion (better than
   115 dB) to the evaluation board at the VIN+ input. To attain the
   requisite low distortion, which is necessary to allow true evaluation
   of the part, one option is to filter the input signal from the ac
   source. Choose an appropriate band-pass filter based on the
   sinusoidal signal applied.

2. Click the **FFT** tab from the main window.

3. Click **Single Capture** or **Continuous Capture**.

As in the histogram test, raw data is then captured and passed to the
PC, which performs the FFT and displays the resulting SNR, THD, and
SINAD.

Figure 18 displays the spectral analysis results of the captured data.

-  The plot is the FFT image of the raw data.

-  The **FFT Analysis** box displays the performance data: SNR, THD, SINAD,
   dynamic range, and noise performance along with the input signal
   characteristics (see label 1 in Figure 18).

-  Clicking **Show Harmonic Content** (labeled 2 in Figure 18) displays the
   frequency and amplitude of the fundamental in addition to the second
   to fifth harmonics.

Loading Captured Data

The software can load previously captured data for analysis.

From the File menu, select Load Captured Data. Only data that was
previously captured and saved can be opened. The raw data is used to
rebuild the histogram and ac spectrum analyses upon being loaded into
the evaluation platform.

When Load Captured Data is selected, the Open file dialog box in Figure
22 opens for loading an appropriate file. The evaluation software
expects that a previously generated waveform file is in .csv format.
