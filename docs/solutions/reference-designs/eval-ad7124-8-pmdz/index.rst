EVAL-AD7124-8-PMDZ
==================

8-Channel, Low Noise, Low Power, 24-Bit, Sigma-Delta ADC with PGA and Reference Pmod Board

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-AD7124-8-PMDZ` is a minimalist 8-channel, low noise,
low power, 24-bit, sigma-delta ADC with PGA and reference, SPI Pmod board
for the :adi:`AD7124-8`. This module is designed as a low-cost
alternative to the fully-featured :adi:`AD7124-8` evaluation board
and has no extra signal conditioning for the ADC.

All pins of the :adi:`AD7124-8` are exposed, which makes the
:adi:`EVAL-AD7124-8-PMDZ` very flexible and easy to use.

About the AD7124-8
------------------

The :adi:`AD7124-8` is a low power, low noise, completely integrated
analog front end for high precision measurement applications. The device
contains a low noise, 24-bit ΣΔ analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and can be
configured to have 8 differential inputs or 15 single-ended or
pseudo-differential inputs. The on-chip programmable gain amplifier (PGA) allows
small amplitude signals to be interfaced directly to the ADC.

One of the major advantages of the :adi:`AD7124-8` is that it gives
the user the flexibility to employ one of three integrated power modes. The
current consumption, range of output data rates, and RMS noise can be tailored
with the power mode selected. The device also offers a multitude of filter
options, ensuring that the user has the highest degree of flexibility.

The :adi:`AD7124-8` establishes the highest degree of signal chain
integration. The device includes a precision, low noise, low drift internal
bandgap reference, and accepts an external differential reference, which can be
internally buffered. Other key integrated features include programmable low
drift excitation current sources, burnout detection currents, and a bias voltage
generator, which sets the common-mode voltage of a channel to AVDD/2. The
low-side power switch enables the user to power down bridge sensors between
conversions, ensuring the absolute minimal power consumption of the system. The
device also allows the user the option of operating with either an internal
clock or an external clock.

The integrated channel sequencer allows several channels to be enabled
simultaneously, and the :adi:`AD7124-8` sequentially converts on
each enabled channel, simplifying communication with the device. As many as 16
channels can be enabled at any time, where a channel is defined as an analog
input or a diagnostic function such as a power supply check or a reference
check. This unique feature allows diagnostics to be interleaved with
conversions. The :adi:`AD7124-8` also supports per channel
configuration. The device allows eight configurations or setups. Each
configuration consists of PGA gain, filter type, output data rate, buffering,
and reference source. The user can assign any of these setups on a
channel-by-channel basis.

The :adi:`AD7124-8` also has extensive diagnostic functionality
integrated as part of its comprehensive feature set. These diagnostics include a
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the SPI data, signal chain checks, and serial
interface checks, which lead to a more robust solution. These diagnostics reduce
the need for external components to implement diagnostics, resulting in reduced
board space needs, reduced design cycle times and cost savings. The failure
modes effects and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) of a typical application has shown
a safe failure fraction (SFF) greater than 90% according to IEC 61508.

The device operates with a single analog power supply from 2.7V to 3.6V or a
dual 1.8V power supply. The digital supply has a range of 1.65V to 3.6V,
eliminating the need for external logic level shifters.

Connectors and Configuration
----------------------------

By default, the :adi:`EVAL-AD7124-8-PMDZ` is configured to
be controlled and power from the Pmod connector using standard connections. So
no additional configuration is required, unless you want to customize it.

AD7124-8 Inputs/Outputs Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the analog and digital input/output pins available on the
:adi:`EVAL-AD7124-8-PMDZ` are brought out to two (2)
separate 16 row 0.1” gold plated through holes.

.. note::
   Not all pins require inputs. The following pins are exposed and
   can be used if necessary if they are first disconnected from their default
   onboard connection if that connection exists. (AVSS, AVDD, REFIN1(+), REFIN1(-),
   CLK, REFOUT, SYNC, PSW). Please refer to the datasheet to learn more about their
   function.
