EVAL-CN0555-EBZ
===============

USB-Powered, 433.92 MHz RF Low Noise Amplifier Receiver with Overpower Protection.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`CN0555` is a two-stage, USB-powered, RF low noise amplifier
that is optimized for receiver signal chains in the 433.92 MHz 
industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. It provides a gain 
of 40 dB through its RF band of operation using two :adi:`ADL5523`
amplifiers cascaded together, boosting signals for various 
communication protocols such as
`ISM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band>`__,
`MC-GSM <https://www.google.com/search?q=mc-gsm>`__,
`W-CDMA <https://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/104-w-cdma>`__,
`TD-SCDMA <http://www.telecomabc.com/t/tdcdma.html>`__, and
`LTE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_%28telecommunication%29>`__ .

It includes a high-speed overpower cutoff that protects sensitive
downstream equipment connected to the receiver system and automatically
turns back on when the RF power level drops within the acceptable range.

Designed to be used with the :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO`, the 
:adi:`EVAL-CN0555-EBZ` features a small form-factor with dimensions 
of 25.4 mm × 50.673 mm x 1.5748 mm (PCB only). The reference design 
uses standard 50 Ω SMA coaxial connectors for its RF signal path — 
for easy integration with any RF systems; a female connector is used
for the RF input and a male connector is used for the RF output. 
Coplanar waveguides are used for the RF traces on the board, which 
have a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. A micro USB connector is used 
for the input power, allowing the evaluation board to use most +5 V 
wall-wart power supplies available in the market.

   EVAL-CN0555-EBZ Reference Design Board

The :adi:`CN0555` reference design features the :adi:`ADL5523`, 
which is a high performance 
`GaAs pHEMT <https://www.google.com/search?q=gaas-phemt>`__
low noise amplifier. It provides a high gain and low noise figure for
single down-conversion intermediate frequency (IF) sampling receiver
architectures, as well as direct down-conversion receivers. It is easy
to tune and only requires a few external components. The device can
support operation voltages from 3 V to 5 V and the current draw can be
adjusted with external bias resistors for applications requiring very
low power consumption.

The :adi:`ADL5904` is a dual-function RF TruPwr detector that 
operates from dc to 6 GHz. It provides rms power measurement along 
with a programmable envelope threshold detection function. The 
RMS power measurement function has a 45 dB detection range, 
nominally from −30 dBm to +15 dBm. The rms power measurement
function also features low power consumption and an intrinsically
ripple-free error transfer function.

   CN0555 Primary Side

SMA Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SMA connectors are used for the RF input and output connections.

- **J1** is the **RF Input** SMA female connector that would be
  connected to an antenna.
- **J2** is the **RF Output** SMA male connector that would be connected
  to a radio or piece of RF equipment.

LED Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reference design uses two LEDs to indicate its current status.

- The Red LED **(DS1)** lights up when an overpowering event occurs.
- The Green LED **(DS2)** lights up when the power is present on the
  board.

- **P1** is the micro USB port used to provide 5 V power to the board.

Getting Started
---------------

Required Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware
^^^^^^^^

- :adi:`EVAL-CN0555-EBZ`
- :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO`
- Two (2) micro USB power adaptor or micro USB to USB cable for powering
  ADALM-PLUTO and EVAL-CN0555-EBZ
- One (1) SMA male-to-male cable
- One (1) SMA 10 dB RF attenuator

Firmware
^^^^^^^^

- :git-plutosdr-fw:`Pluto firmware 0.30 version <releases/download/v0.30/plutosdr-fw-v0.30.zip+>`

ADALM-PLUTO Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firmware Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Download :git-plutosdr-fw:`Pluto firmware 0.30 version <releases/download/v0.30/plutosdr-fw-v0.30.zip+>`

#.  Unzip the downloaded file.

#.  Connect Pluto to host PC or laptop using a micro USB cable in the
    terminal with a USB symbol.

#.  Open the Pluto mass storage device.

#.  Open the unzipped firmware file.

#.  Copy the file, *pluto.frm*, to the Pluto mass storage device.

#.  This will cause LED1 to blink rapidly. This means that programming
    is taking place. Do not remove power (or USB) while the device is
    blinking rapidly. It takes approximately four minutes to properly
    program the device.

#.  Once the device finishes programming, it will reappear as a mass
    storage device.

#.  Eject (don’t unplug) the Pluto mass storage device.
