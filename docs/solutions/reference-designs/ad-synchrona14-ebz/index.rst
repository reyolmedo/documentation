AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ
==================

Multichannel System Clocking Device.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ` is an ideal self-contained device suitable
for applications that require a highly accurate frequency and
phase-controlled source clock. It is designed around the
:adi:`AD9545`, a quad input synchronizer and jitter cleaner, and the 
:adi:`HMC7044`, a 3.2 GHz, 14-output high performance jitter attenuator. 
This board greatly simplifies clock distribution and multichannel 
synchronization in complex systems. Using popular industry connectors 
such as SMA and 
`Samtec Circular RF Twinax <https://www.samtec.com/cables/high-speed/assemblies/shielded>`__,
most labs have cables that are compatible with this device. It is
intended for use in a lab environment by trained professionals for
evaluation and prototyping purposes and can be used as a reference
design for integrating into custom applications.

With its on-board internal oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO),
the AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ can operate in standalone mode or be fed from a
choice of external sources such as three separate high speed
differential clock inputs, a 10 MHz reference, and a 1 pps input. This
flexibility, combined with the capability to select either of the
internal voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) options of 100 MHz
or 122.88 MHz, gives almost unlimited choice for the frequency of
interest and accuracy needed for a wide variety of application areas.

Clock Output Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a total of 14 high speed clocks that come out of the final
clock mux; these can range from 2150 MHz to 3550 MHz in different modes
and connection schemes. The maximum clock output is 2400 MHz, which can
be divided down by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and even numbers up to 4094.
Moreover, the output clock resolution depends on the “Clock Distribution
Frequency”, and the divider value.

The outputs are hardware configurable as **LVPECL**, 
**LVDS**, and **CMOS**.


**Maximum Operating Frequency**

========== =========================
**LVPECL** 2400 MHz (3 dB bandwidth)
**LVDS**   1700 MHz
**CMOS**   600 MHz

Check the :adi:`HMC7044` data sheet (page 21) for more details on 
output configuration.

100 Ω Differential Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CH11, CH12, CH13, and CH14 are 100 Ω impedance differential outputs with
circular RF Twinax Jack.

The `CJT-BH connector series <https://www.samtec.com/products/cjt-bh>`__
from Samtec are paired with 
`C28S connector series <https://www.samtec.com/products/c28s>`__
– Circular RF Twinax Cable Assembly.

Clock Input (Reference Input)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the back panel, there are 3 differential 100 Ω inputs.

In the standard configuration, **CH1** is disconnected from the SMA
connectors. The reason for this is that inside the AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ,
there are two temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXOs)
connected to this channel (38.4 MHz and 40 MHz). To use the SMA
cables, insert C69 and C70, and remove C282 and C134.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **CH2** goes directly into                                            |
| :adi:`HMC7044` and it is ac-coupled.                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **CH3** goes directly into                                            |
| :adi:`HMC7044` and it is dc-coupled.                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **PPS** is a CMOS input for 1 pps reference. The range for this input |
| is from 1.8 V to 5 V.                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **SYNC** is a 3.3 V CMOS input that goes directly into                |
| :adi:`HMC7044` sync pin.                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **REF_IN** is a 50 Ω input with a maximum input power of 10 dBm. With |
| the standard software version, this input is set to function with a   |
| 10 MHz reference. The maximum input frequency is 160 MHz (–3dB).      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **REF_OUT** is a CMOS output of the REF_IN buffer.                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Internal References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two **VCXOs**, ultralow phase noise oscillators (-165dBc/Hz).

The VCXOs are 100 MHz and 122.88 MHz; both of which are software
selectable and used to drive the PLL2 of :adi:`HMC7044`.

There are also two **TCXOs** (±1 ppm), 40 MHz and 38.4 MHz that can be
used as reference for PLL1 of :adi:`HMC7044`.

Switching between VCXOs goes together with switching the TCXOs; 100
MHz with 40 MHz, and 122.88 MHz with 38.4 MHz.

The :adi:`AD9545` has a **50 MHz OCXO** (±10 ppb) reference, 
so AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ can be used as a standalone device, 
providing high frequency stability.

GUI
---

The Raspberry Pi inside AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ runs the **RaspAP**, which is
an application that gives access to the GUI.

- To access the GUI, the user must first get the IP of the device.
- In the default configuration, AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ has the IP set as
  static **192.168.2.1**

.. note::
    
    Make sure that you are using an IP in the same class on your PC.

To find the IP of the SYNCHRONA:

- Connect the add-on board that you received along with the 
  AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ, in the back to the GPIO port
- Make sure Enable jumper P4 is **not connected**
- Connect an USB cable from it to your PC
- Power on SYNCHRONA
- Open a terminal (i.e. PuTTY)
- Select the COM and 115200 baud rate
- Wait a few seconds then hit any key to see if it booted already
- Type **ifconfig**. This should look like this:

  .. shell::
     :user: root
     :group: analog

      Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 analog ttyS0

      analog login: root (automatic login)

      Linux analog 5.10.63-v7l+ #1 SMP Fri May 6 11:30:22 UTC 2022 armv7l

- Now you need to enable DHCP on SYNCHRONA. 
  You need to do the followings:

  .. shell::
     :user: root
     :group: analog

     $ cd /linux_image_ADI-scripts/
     $ ./enable_dhcp.sh
     $ reboot

- Wait for the device to reboot. When all is done, you should see the
  initial text like in the code snippet from above
- Now, typing **ifconfig** should give you a different address from the
  default one which was inet 192.168.2.1
- Type the IP in your browser to access the GUI. The default username is
  **admin** and the password is **analog**.

There are two VCXOs inside the AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ. Based on the
frequencies you set in the General Page, the switch between the two
VCXOs will be done automatically and the PLL frequency will be
calculated.

.. important::

   The values on each channel need to be submultiples 
   of the PLL frequency.

If one or more of the values cannot be obtained from dividing the PLL
frequency, the GUI will return the message:


**Invalid Frequencies: Cannot solve HMC7044 clock configuration…**


To apply the settings you made, click on the **Reload Config** button.

**Coarse delay** is another feature you can find in the 
**General Page**. Coarse delay can be set in step that are 
calculated based on the VCO frequency. Use the arrows in the coarse 
delay field to modify the coarse delay. The value is set 
in picoseconds. This feature can be used to compensate for 
unmatched RF cables.

Use Cases
---------

Standalone Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ can be used as a standalone device 
without the need of an external clock reference.

Inside the AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ, there is a Raspberry Pi 
connected to all the clock ICs that run all the drivers.

In the standalone use case, the main clock reference is the 50 MHz
OCXO (Rakon U8216LF) that feeds the :adi:`AD9545` clock IC. 
The 50 MHz OCXO used in this design has a frequency stability 
over temperature of ±10 ppb, and a warm up time of about 
60 seconds for the reference frequency to be within ±20 ppb.

The :adi:`AD9545` can provide any clock frequency up to 500 MHz. 
The differential output OUT1_A of the :adi:`AD9545` is 
connected directly (ac-coupled) to PLL1 reference input (CLKIN2) of
:adi:`HMC7044`. The reference input to PLL2 of :adi:`HMC7044` 
is connected via an RF switch to two ultralow phase noise VCXOs.

   AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ Functional Block Diagram

The AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ also includes 100 MHz and 122.88 MHz VCXOs,
making it capable to provide frequencies for instrumentation and telecom
applications. Depending on the type of application and range of
frequencies you want to use, the firmware will automatically switch
between the VCXOs and change the output frequency of :adi:`AD9545`.

ADD-ON Voltage Translation Board
--------------------------------

.. figure:: ad-synchrona-ebz.jpg
   :align: center

   Add-on Voltage Translation Board

Inside the AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ package, you can find an ADD-ON board that
allows you to connect via SPI with an external CPU or FPGA. It has
voltage translators able to function from 0.9 V to 5 V. It also gives
access to the Raspberry Pi UART via USB.

When the EN jumper (enable) is placed, the SPI interface is 
disconnected from the Raspberry Pi inside, allowing external SPI control.

The VIO_SELECT allows the user to select V_IO voltage of 1.8 V 
(on-board) or the external V_IO voltage connected on P3.

The VCXO 100 MHz jumper forces the use of the 100 MHz VCXO 
inside AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ.
